# RGB-button

This is a code that takes a input from a button that makes a RGB-light light in diffrent colors evertime you push the button. 

## How it works

The program takes a a input from the button. The button är also conected to a pullupp resistor wich makes the rest of the current in the conduktor go to GND (ground). With the input the program sends a signal to the RGB light that makes it lit. The program do also take the input and count haw many times the button has been push. And with that data, the program send difrent signals that makes the RGB light light up in diffrent colors or makes the light turn off.
